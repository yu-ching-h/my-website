    "## 1. Introduction to VAEs in Anomaly Detection\n",
    "### 1.1 What is a VAE?\n",
    "VAEs are a class of generative models that learn a compressed latent representation of the data. Intuitively, they learn the inherent structure of the data, so that it can be reconstructed just by providing a few values. As an analogy, imagine that you were asked to describe any object to someone just from basic shapes, so that they can draw it. It would take ages to explain everything in enough detail. Now, imaging you can tell them the object is in fact a dog. Immediately, it becomes much easier to explain, and within a few minutes, you should be able to give a pretty accurate description of the dog. This is because you and your friend share a common knowledge of what constitutes a dog and what distinguishes one dog from another. With this pre-learned knowledge, the description of the object becomes much more compact. \n",
    "\n",
    "To learn this structure, the VAE has two parts: An encoder and a decoder. The compact representation (the \"latent vector\") is sandwiched between these two parts. During training, we present the encoder with data samples that it converts into latent vectors. Then the decoder takes the latent vectors and tries to reconstruct the data samples. By minimising the recontruction error (plus a regularisation loss, more on that later), the encoder gets better at compressing the data into a meaningful latent vector, and the decoder becomes better at converting this latent vector into plausible reconstructed samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we also need to make sure that the VAE is able to reconstruct samples outside of the training set, i.e. to generalise. This is achieved by penalising (\"regularising\") the reconstruction loss with an additional term, the Kullback-Leibler Divergence. In broad terms, this ensures that the VAE learns the distribution of the data, rather than the datapoints themselves. There is much more to the theory of VAEs (e.g. the \"reparameterisation trick\") but this is outside the scope of this notebook. You can learn a lot more about VAEs [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05908) \\[1\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Why use a VAE in Anomaly Detection?\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind Anomaly Detection is to detect samples that are far from what is usually seen, in some sense or other. The definition of \"far\" is the difficult bit. In simple, one-dimensional cases, we could just look at the value tracked over time and decide that extreme values are anomalies. Lots of methods use this idea in more or less sophisticated ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, things become trickier in higher-dimensional spaces where variables interact with each other or are correlated in some non-obvious ways. Sure, a sheep is \"far\" from a dog, but how do you formalise this distance? Its size is clearly not enough: some dogs are as big or larger than sheeps. Colour doesn't work either -- there are black sheeps and white dogs. Ear shape -- let's not even go there. The decision will clearly require a combination of many variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where VAEs come in useful. As we saw, a VAE trained on dogs will have learned a latent, non-explicit representation of the structural features of a dog. What will happen if we pass it an instance of a sheep? It will try to reconstruct the sheep, but since the structure of a sheep is different to that of a dog, most likely the reconstruction will not be very good. As a result, the reconstruction loss will probably be quite poor on this particular sample, much worse than on dog instances -- at least if our VAE has benn properly trained. By detecting data samples that cause a large reconstruction loss, we can therefore hope to identify anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process is as follows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Gather and preprocess data, including train/test split,\n",
    "- Build a VAE and train it on the training set,\n",
    "- Pass test samples to the VAE and record the reconstruction loss for each,\n",
    "- Identify test samples with a reconstruction loss higher than some criterion and flag them as anomalies."

    "In this notebook, we will use one of the public datasets available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/boltzmannbrain/nab\n",
    "It contains many one-dimensional timeseries, but to make things a bit more interesting, we will do some feature engineering and make the data multi-dimensional. This is also often useful in improving the accuracy of any model."

For this project, I am using [Pytorch-Lightning](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a thin layer on top of Pytorch that handles a lot of the tedious tasks such as writing a training loop. The experiments are recorded using [Weights and Biases](https://app.wandb.ai/), but you can use whatever method you want, or none."

    "Embedding vectors are a notion that is heavily used in Natural Language Processing. They are learnable vectors (of dimension 16 in our experiments) that express some non-explicit features of the variables. For instance, the vector for `day_of_week` can take 7 different sets of values (one for each day), each 16-dimensional. Depending on the value of this variable for each sample, the corresponding vector is retrieved in a lookup table, passed to the network, and updated during backpropagation. The vector for `day_of_week==0` could eventually capture the fact that the machine's activity is lower on such days, for instance. The important thing is that this learning is done without our intervention, and there is no easy way to interpret the learned embeddings."

    "Hopefully, we should find a test loss that is fairly close to the training loss, indicating that we are not overfitting. A good way to regularise training would be creating a separate validation set and stopping the training early when the loss computed on that set starts to increase (or stops decreasing). Pytorch-Lightning makes early stopping extremely easy to implement: once you have created the validation set, it is just a case of passing an additional argument to the Trainer class. Note also that we could probably improve on these results by further optimising hyperparameters (WandB actually offers an easy framework for running hyperparameter optimisation by random, grid or Bayesian search). For now, let's go with these weights and see if the model can find outliers."

The threshold that we defined can be adjusted to favour precision or recall and the optimal value could be determined by the area under the precision-recall curve.
